5. If you have finished fewer than three pomodoros, go back to Step 2 and repeat until you go through all three pomodoros.

A tomato-shaped Pomodoro kitchen timer
A Pomodoro kitchen timer, after which the method is named.
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s.[1] It uses a timer to break work into intervals, typically 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for tomato, after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer Cirillo used as a university student.[2][3]
